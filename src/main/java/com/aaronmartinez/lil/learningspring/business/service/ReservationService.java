    /* This is technically not required, since there is only one constructor. Spring will use it by default, and assume it has
        all of the beans defined in the application context.
        
        Some benefits by specifiying this on Constructor:
            1. IDE is smart enough to know if bean has been defined in application context that would run with application. It
                will give warning that it doesn't know of bean type
            2. other benefit is that it is very clear what constructor is being called at any point in time. If someone comes in
                and adds another constructor, they would have to make the change to make that the autowired constructor.*/
